# rat_track
Research project under UofT and UHN. Still under development. 

The project is aiming to utilize Computer Vision to generate a dataset which will be used in machinine learning training later on. The rodent experiment's setup is complex and cannot use available software.

I'be been working locally since day one, and Aug.26 2018 is my initial commit. At the time of initial commit, the program is able to find the centroid of the rat reliably. I'm still working on the alorithm that finds the head position. Several files are either not part of the program anymore (testing purpose, failed attempts) or is still under development.
